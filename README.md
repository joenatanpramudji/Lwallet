# Lwallet is my final year project mobile application which is a prototype payment application. 
# We used Firebase realtime database to store the data and we also implement a tokenization feature which is stored on a seperate application
# Please email to okuwagapramudji@gmail.com for firebase console access because there are still some incomplete features which needs firebase console.

To use the app
1. You need an android device
2. Install android studio
3. Open the project
4. Run the main class
5. Open the Isever folder
6. Run the test.java class inside the src folder
7. For development purposes you can only use our prototype user (username:Joenatan, password:jp123456)
8. When you want to transfer or top up, the app will ask for a pin number which can be seen from the firebase console (Bank->Joenatan->Token)
9. Enjoy lol!
